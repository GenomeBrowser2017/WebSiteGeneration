		<h3>BIOL7210-A Computational Genomics 2017-A Genome Browser</h3>

			"Outbreak" isolates.</p>

	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<div>
		<p>
			<i>Salmonella enterica</i> subsp. <i>enterica</i> serovar Heidelberg
			is a foodborne pathogen that can be transferred from animals to
			humans and can also cause a dangerous bacterial infection if it comes
			in contact with a human host. Even though it is rather dangerous, it
			is still fairly common to see the outbreaks and spread of this
			bacterium through contaminated poultry meat circulating around the
			market, especially in North America. <i>S.</i> Heidelberg is the
			second most common serovar isolated from humans in the U.S., and
			accounts for 8.6% of ceftriaxone-resistant Salmonella isolated from
			humans in the U.S. The recent 2013 outbreak, linked to raw chicken,
			was caused by a multidrug resistant <i>S.</i> Heidelberg strain
			(resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin,
			streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline).
		</p>
		<p>Outbreak isolates are clusters of three or more isolates that
			are reported within 60 days and have the same PFGE pattern along with
			epidemiological links like location and food source. This browser was
			given biological samples from year 2013 from the Center for Disease
			Control in order to illuminate some information on these potentially
			dangerous outbreaks. These particular outbreak isolates are of
			interest to the CDC because they had a very short incubation period
			of ~3 hours compared to the standard ~72 hour incubation period.</p>
		<p>
			The goal of this browser is to be able to identify and display
			pertinent information in regards to the full genome of 24 strains of
			<i>S.</i> Heidelberg in order to shed light on their pathogenicity
			and virulence so as to further facilitate steps to limit, contain and
			extinguish harmful cases towards humans.
